# Pretendo Network developer documentation
Documentation on libraries and core concepts used to make NEX/Rendez-Vous game servers/clients

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This site relies on [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and the `Guider` package from https://github.com/mrjvs/neatojs. This does not have an official NPM release. The only way to run this app is to:
> 1. Clone the monorepo AND the correct branch `git clone -b final-todos-guider https://github.com/mrjvs/neatojs`
> 2. `cd neatojs/packages/guider`
> 3. `pnpm build` to build the `Guider` package
> 4. `cd ../../examples/guider`
> 5. `git clone https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/developer-documentation`
> 6. `cd developer-documentation`
> 7. `pnpm i` to install the workspace dependencies
> 8. `pnpm dev`
>
> Once a full release is available, remove these steps
