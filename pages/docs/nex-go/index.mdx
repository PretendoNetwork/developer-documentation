# `nex-go`

## Overview
`nex-go` is the lowest level library in the [NEX](/overview/nex) stack, written in the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language. This library provides both the lower level transport protocols, as well as some higher level types and utility methods.

For other parts of the NEX stack, see below

- [nex-protocols-go](/docs/nex-protocols-go) - NEX service handlers
- [nex-protocols-common-go](/docs/nex-protocols-common-go) - Reusable implementations for common NEX services found in many game servers

## Quazal Rendez-Vous
Nintendo did not make NEX from scratch. NEX is largely based on an existing library called Rendez-Vous, made by Canadian software company Quazal. Quazal licensed Rendez-Vous out to many other companies, and was eventually bought out by Ubisoft. Because of this, Rendez-Vous is seen in many many other games on all major platforms, especially Ubisoft.

Nintendo modified Rendez-Vous somewhat heavily, simplifying the library/transport protocol quite a bit, and adding several custom services.

<Note>
While the main goal of this library is to support games which use the NEX variant of Rendez-Vous made by Nintendo, we also aim to be compatible with games using the original Rendez-Vous library. Due to the extensible nature of Rendez-Vous, many games may feature customizations much like NEX and have non-standard features/behavior. We do our best to support these cases, but there may be times where supporting all variations becomes untenable. In those cases, a fork of these libraries should be made instead if they require heavy modifications.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/PretendoNetwork/nex-go
```

## Example
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/PretendoNetwork/nex-go"
	"github.com/PretendoNetwork/nex-go/types"
)

func main() {
	// Skeleton of a Wii U/3DS Friends server running on PRUDPv0 with a single endpoint

	authServer := nex.NewPRUDPServer() // The main PRUDP server
	endpoint := nex.NewPRUDPEndPoint(1) // A PRUDP endpoint for PRUDP connections to connect to. Bound to StreamID 1
	endpoint.ServerAccount = nex.NewAccount(types.NewPID(1), "Quazal Authentication", "password"))
	endpoint.AccountDetailsByPID = accountDetailsByPID
	endpoint.AccountDetailsByUsername = accountDetailsByUsername

	// Setup event handlers for the endpoint
	endpoint.OnData(func(packet nex.PacketInterface) {
		if packet, ok := packet.(nex.PRUDPPacketInterface); ok {
			request := packet.RMCMessage()

			fmt.Println("[AUTH]", request.ProtocolID, request.MethodID)

			if request.ProtocolID == 0xA { // TicketGrantingProtocol
				if request.MethodID == 0x1 { // TicketGrantingProtocol::Login
					handleLogin(packet)
				}

				if request.MethodID == 0x3 { // TicketGrantingProtocol::RequestTicket
					handleRequestTicket(packet)
				}
			}
		}
	})

	// Bind the endpoint to the server and configure it's settings
	authServer.BindPRUDPEndPoint(endpoint)
	authServer.SetFragmentSize(962)
	authServer.LibraryVersions.SetDefault(nex.NewLibraryVersion(1, 1, 0))
	authServer.SessionKeyLength = 16
	authServer.AccessKey = "ridfebb9"
	authServer.Listen(60000)
}
