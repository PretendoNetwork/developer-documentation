# `Protocol.Patches`

## Type
```go
nex.ServiceProtocol
```

## Description
Custom protocol patches. When not `nil` and an RMC method with an ID set in <CodeLink href="/docs/nex-protocols-go/datastore/Protocol/fields/PatchedMethods">`Protocol.PatchedMethods`</CodeLink> is sent, this protocols handler is called instead. Used for overriding existing RMC method implementations and adding support for new/custom/game-specific RMC methods.
